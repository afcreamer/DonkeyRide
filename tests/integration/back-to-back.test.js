/**
 * Back-to-back dispatch.
 *
 * A provider ten minutes from their drop-off is invisible to every request
 * around that drop-off, so they finish a job into an empty screen and then
 * drive back across town for the next one. Once they are close to the end
 * of an active job, dispatch also judges them from where that job ENDS —
 * in addition to where they currently are, never instead of it.
 *
 * Runs on a deliberately tight dispatch radius: with the ridesharing
 * default of 15 km nothing would be out of reach and the test would prove
 * nothing.
