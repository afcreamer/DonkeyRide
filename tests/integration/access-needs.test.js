/**
 * Access needs (wheelchair, child seat, assistance dog, extra luggage…).
 *
 * These are REQUIREMENTS, not a price band: a wheelchair user may want a
 * Standard car, and needing a child seat must not price someone into
 * Comfort. So they filter WHO can take the job and never touch the fare.
 *
 * Everything here fails closed, on the same reasoning as women-only
 * matching: a provider who has not declared a feature never sees the job
 * and cannot accept it. The failure this prevents is not a mismatched ride
 * — it is a wheelchair user watching a car they cannot board drive away.
 *
 * Also proves the data never leaves the operator's memory: health-adjacent
 * information must not reach a public relay, so it is absent from the
 * kind 30078 snapshot exactly like the women-only flag.
