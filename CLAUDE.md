# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

DonkeyRide is the **reference implementation** of the [TROTT Protocol](https://github.com/TheCryptoDonkey/trott) (**T**rusted **R**eal-world **O**rchestration of **T**asks & **T**rades) — a suite of 8 specifications for trust-minimised physical service coordination built on Nostr (decentralised messaging) with **payment-agnostic** financial rails (Lightning, Cashu, Strike, Stripe, NIP-47, and more). This repo contains the **reference operator server** — a Node.js backend that coordinates tasks and records commitments. It is deliberately **non-custodial**: it never receives, holds, or transmits funds (see "Non-custodial + database-free" below). It is not a ridesharing company; it's a working implementation that generalises across 10+ domains (ridesharing, locksmith dispatch, parcel delivery, court serving, security guard dispatch, emergency trades, cleaning, moving, and more).

**Protocol specifications** (TROTT-01 through TROTT-08, domain profiles, implementor guides) live in the dedicated [trott repository](https://github.com/TheCryptoDonkey/trott). This repo focuses on implementation only.

## Commands

```bash
npm start              # Run operator server (Express on PORT=3000, WebSocket on WS_PORT=3001)
npm run dev            # Development mode with nodemon auto-reload
npm test               # Run all tests (Node.js built-in test runner)
npm run test:live      # Live relay tests — opt-in, hits wss://relay.trotters.cc
npm run web:dev        # React frontend dev server (Vite, in web/)
npm run web:build      # Build React frontend (tsc + vite build)
npm run web:test       # Run frontend tests (vitest)
npm run docker:build   # Build Docker image
npm run docker:run     # Run Docker container with .env
```

**Run a single test file:**
```bash
node --test tests/integration/reputation-flow.test.js
node --test tests/integration/domain-profiles.test.js
```

`npm test` selects files with `tests/helpers/list-test-files.js` rather than a
shell glob. `tests/**/*.test.js` looks recursive but npm runs scripts under
`sh`, where `**` is just `*` — it matched exactly one directory deep, so a test
at `tests/unit/nested/x.test.js` would have been silently skipped rather than
failing loudly. The walker is also version-independent: bare `node --test` does
discover recursively, but its naming conventions have shifted across releases
and CI runs Node 20 and 22. It replaced a `find` expression that had both of
those properties but left `npm test` unrunnable on Windows, where npm runs
scripts under `cmd.exe` — no `find`, no command substitution. CI reads the same
module rather than a second copy of the rule, so the two selections cannot
drift. Live tests are excluded here and run via `npm run test:live`, so
`npm test` never touches the network. Windows specifics, including the regtest
harness, are in [docs/WINDOWS-DEV.md](docs/WINDOWS-DEV.md).

**Frontend dependencies are separate** — run `npm install` in `web/` before using `web:*` commands.

**Nix development environment** (recommended):
```bash
nix develop                # Enter dev shell with Node.js 22, psql, redis-cli, etc.
nix run .#services         # Start all services (PostgreSQL, Redis, strfry, mock-lightning, OSRM)
npm run dev                # Start operator server with auto-reload
npm run dev:nix            # Shortcut: starts services + operator together
```

**Docker Compose** (alternative, also used for production):
```bash
docker compose up                          # Production services
docker compose --profile dev up            # Adds mock-lightning, adminer, redis-commander
```

**Run with a different domain:**
```bash
DOMAIN=locksmith npm start           # Locksmith dispatch server
DOMAIN=delivery npm start            # Parcel delivery server
DOMAIN=towing npm start              # Vehicle recovery
DOMAIN=emergency-trades npm start    # Emergency trade callouts
DOMAIN=pet-services npm start        # Dog walking, sitting, grooming
DOMAIN=security npm start            # Security officer assignments
DOMAIN=cleaning npm start            # Domestic and specialist cleaning
DOMAIN=moving npm start              # House and office moves
DOMAIN=ridesharing npm start         # Default ridesharing (same as no DOMAIN)
```

## Architecture

### Domain Profile System

The protocol is **domain-agnostic**. One codebase serves multiple use cases via domain profiles loaded at startup from the `DOMAIN` env var (defaults to `ridesharing`).

```
src/domain-profiles/
├── schema.js          # Profile validation and schema definition
├── loader.js          # Loads profiles by ID, resolution order: built-in → file path
├── index.js           # Barrel export
├── ridesharing.js     # Default: rider/driver, geohash discovery, distance+time pricing
├── locksmith.js       # customer/locksmith, flatRate pricing, quote negotiation
├── delivery.js        # sender/courier, extra COLLECTED state, photo+signature proofs
├── towing.js          # motorist/recovery operator, binding on-site quote before loading
├── emergency-trades.js# householder/tradesperson, milestone pricing, trade as a requirement
├── pet-services.js    # pet owner/carer, check-in→session→check-out, carer stakes higher
├── security.js        # client/officer, shift cycling station↔patrol↔incident, SIA gated
├── cleaning.js        # client/cleaner, one session per task, symmetric stakes
└── moving.js          # client/mover, loading→transit→unloading milestones
```

Each profile defines: state machine (states + valid transitions), role names (requester/provider), UI labels (origin/destination/task noun/instructions), pricing model, discovery method, completion proof types, rating criteria, feature flags, regulatory bodies, and Nostr event kind mappings.

**Every profile must be drivable end to end.** A profile can validate perfectly and still be unusable: `startTrip`/`completeTrip` go through `validateTransition` like anything else, so a domain whose extra states sit between arrival and work must still leave an edge into `ACTIVE` and `COMPLETED`. `tests/integration/spec-domains.test.js` walks EVERY built-in profile through the full lifecycle for exactly this reason, and pins the state keys the engine reaches for by name (`REQUESTED`, `MATCHED`, `PROVIDER_EN_ROUTE`, `PROVIDER_ARRIVED`, `ACTIVE`, `COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED`, `NO_SHOW`).

**Requirements vs price bands.** `serviceOptions` scale the whole rate card (recovery method, crew size); `accessOptions` never touch the fare and fail closed (trade qualifications, SIA licence categories, "reactive dog", "key-held access"). A domain whose profile sets `labels.accessRequesterTitle`/`accessProviderTitle` replaces the journey-flavoured default copy in `AccessNeedsPicker` — asking a gas engineer what they need "for this journey" reads wrong.

**Multi-provider is not supported.** `moving` models a crew of 2-6 in the spec; this engine records ONE provider per task, so the lead mover is the provider of record and the crew split is settled among themselves. Per-mover acceptance and TROTT-04 split payments need multi-provider support in `TaskManager` first.

**To add a new domain:** create `src/domain-profiles/{name}.js` exporting a profile object (~120 lines), register it in `loader.js`'s `BUILTIN_PROFILES`, and add it to `LIFECYCLE_PATHS` in `spec-domains.test.js`. The schema validates it on load.

### Task Manager (Generalised State Machine)

`src/task-manager.js` — `TaskManager` is the domain-agnostic lifecycle engine. Parameterised by a domain profile, it manages task creation, state transitions, identity resolution (pubkey/npub), and in-memory storage.

`src/ride-manager.js` — Backward compatibility layer. `RideManager` extends `TaskManager` with the ridesharing profile. All original methods (`createRide`, `acceptRide`, `RideStatus`, etc.) are preserved as aliases. Existing code importing from `ride-manager.js` works without changes.

### Entry Point & Server

`server.js` is the monolithic Express server (~2000 lines). It loads the domain profile, initialises `TaskManager`, and sets up all REST endpoints, the WebSocket server, and the Redis connection. All API routes are defined inline.

**Upfront-price guarantee (do not break this)**: `routeAndPrice()` is the SINGLE managed-mode routing+pricing path, used by both `POST /api/trips/estimate` and `POST /api/rides/request`. The number the rider approves on the confirm screen IS the number recorded on the ride. Blind mode instead binds its quote to Valhalla road totals computed directly by the browser. A missing road router fails visibly; no straight-line fare is substituted. `breakdownSats()` returns base/distance/time rows in sats that sum to the quoted fare EXACTLY. `tests/integration/quote-integrity.test.js` and the client-routing tests pin this.

**Request expiry and escalation**: an unmatched immediate request is re-offered every `REQUEST_RETRY_MS` (default 30 s) on a radius that widens ×1.5 per attempt up to `DISPATCH_RADIUS_MAX_KM` (default 2× the base), emitting a `searching` WS frame each time (attempt, radius, providers notified, time left). At `REQUEST_EXPIRE_MS` (default 5 min) it is cancelled with reason `no_providers` and the rider gets a "no drivers available" screen with retry/book-later — never an indefinite spinner. Pre-booked rides keep their own much longer clock (`sweepImmediateRequest` returns early for them).

**Demand pricing (surge)**: OFF unless `SURGE_ENABLED=true` — turning it on for existing operators would silently raise fares. `surgeFor(pickup)` compares waiting requests to available providers within `SURGE_RADIUS_KM`, needs at least `SURGE_MIN_DEMAND` waiting, is stepped to 0.1 and capped at `SURGE_MAX`. Zero supply never surges (that is a search about to fail, not demand). The multiplier is disclosed in the estimate and echoed back as `surge_multiplier` on request; the server honours `min(live, quoted)`, so a quote can never reprice upward on tap. The uplift is the driver's — a non-custodial operator takes no cut of a fare it never holds.

**Access needs**: domain profiles may define `accessOptions` (wheelchair, step-free, child seat, assistance dog, pet friendly, extra luggage). These are REQUIREMENTS, not a price band — the schema rejects an `accessOptions` entry carrying a `fareMultiplier`, because needing a ramp must never cost more. `access_needs` on a request filters dispatch/replay/open-list (`?access=`) via `accessEligible`, fail closed exactly like women-only, and accept returns 403 naming what is missing. In memory only; deliberately absent from the kind 30078 snapshot (health-adjacent data never reaches a relay).

**Late cancellation**: Mode-A native — reputational, never financial. A cancellation is `lateCancellation` when a provider had committed, `CANCEL_GRACE_MS` (default 2 min) has passed, and the job had not started. The fact travels on the cancel frame; the WRONGED party's client may then sign a kind 30520 event flagged `late_cancel` (rating 1), exactly as `no_show` works. `/rate` accepts both flags on a cancelled ride and nothing else. Both aggregators surface `lateCancelCount`. The operator never asserts it and levies no fee.

**Scheduled rides**: a request may carry `scheduled_for` (unix ms, up to `SCHEDULE_MAX_ADVANCE_MS` ahead, default 30 days). A pre-booked ride is browsable on the open list from the moment it's created — a driver can commit early — but only enters live dispatch (WS broadcast + web push) within `SCHEDULE_DISPATCH_LEAD_MS` (default 15 min) of pickup. A sweep (`SCHEDULE_SWEEP_MS`) dispatches rides whose window has opened, sends a `scheduled_reminder` frame (plus web push to an offline committed driver) for accepted bookings, and auto-cancels unmatched bookings `SCHEDULE_EXPIRE_GRACE_MS` (default 1 h) past their time. `scheduledFor` travels in the kind 30078 snapshot, so bookings survive an operator restart. Client task announcements carry a `scheduled_for` tag and extend their NIP-40 expiration to an hour past pickup.

**Geo-dispatch**: ride requests broadcast to online drivers within `DISPATCH_RADIUS_KM` (default 15) of the pickup — unless the driver has declared **working areas**. `GET /api/rides/open` lists every open request. Payloads carry approximate location and no route geometry. In `blind` mode the coordinator never has the exact itinerary: the matched participants exchange it via a NIP-17 gift wrap. `managed` mode retains the participant-gated operator detail path.

**Moving the pickup**: this is a managed-mode feature. `POST /api/rides/:id/pickup` lets the requester move the meeting point until arrival and recalculates a road route. Blind tasks reject it so an exact mutation cannot bypass the participant-encrypted boundary; participants coordinate changes in encrypted chat.

**Service classes**: domain profiles may define `serviceOptions` (ridesharing ships Standard/Comfort/XL). The chosen class scales the WHOLE rate card via `rateCardOptions(currency, multiplier)`, so the breakdown still sums to the quote; `POST /api/trips/estimate` returns per-class prices. Anything above the default class must be declared by the provider (`service_options` on WS `register_driver`, `POST /api/drivers/location`, push subscribe and accept): an XL request is invisible on broadcast/replay/open-list/push to an undeclared driver, and accept returns 403 (`optionEligible`, fail closed exactly like women-only).

**Favourite providers**: a request may carry `preferred_providers` (≤10 hex pubkeys, device-local list on the rider side). For `FAVOURITE_HEAD_START_MS` (default 45 s) the job is dispatched, listed and acceptable ONLY to those providers (`inFavouriteWindow`/`favouriteEligible`; accept returns 403 with `opens_in_seconds`) — a head start others can out-tap is not a head start — then the sweep opens it to everyone. In memory for the life of the request; never snapshotted. Not applied to pre-booked rides.

**Changing the destination**: this is a managed-mode feature with preview-before-commit road repricing. Blind tasks reject it so exact destination/stops cannot enter the coordinator after booking.

**Cancellation reasons**: `reason_code` on cancel, validated against `CANCELLATION_REASONS` — a fixed per-side vocabulary (a requester cannot claim `vehicle_problem`, a provider cannot claim `found_another_way`). Discoverable at `GET /api/cancellation-reasons`. The code travels on the cancel frame and in the push copy ("The driver cancelled: the pickup was too far"); free text is still accepted alongside and still participant-gated. `reason: 'no_show'` maps to the `no_show` code for backward compatibility.

**Back-to-back dispatch**: a provider on an ACTIVE job whose current position is within `BACK_TO_BACK_LEAD_KM` (default 3) of their drop-off is ALSO judged from that drop-off by `driverInRange` — in addition to where they are, never instead of it. Otherwise a driver ten minutes from finishing is invisible to every request around where they are about to be, and finishes into an empty screen. Working areas still override (cell membership decides), and a job that has not STARTED tells us nothing about where anyone will be. The finishing-provider index is rebuilt on demand with a 1 s TTL.

**Demand ("where the work is")**: `GET /api/demand` aggregates waiting, unmatched, non-pre-booked requests into geohash-5 cells (~5 km) with a waiting count, an idle-provider count and the multiplier a request from that cell would price at. Cells below `DEMAND_MIN_WAITING` (default 2) are suppressed — one person waiting is a doorway, not a pattern. Supply is reported alongside demand deliberately: twelve waiting with thirty idle drivers is not somewhere to drive to.

**Provider credentials**: domain profiles may declare `credentials` (private hire licence, hire-and-reward insurance, SIA badge, goods in transit…). A provider declares theirs device-locally and sends them on accept; they land on the task as `providerCredentials` and are shown to the requester **as a claim** — the operator verifies none of it and no screen says "verified". Expiry is part of the claim, so an expired declaration is dropped by `sanitiseCredentials` rather than displayed. Gating is OFF by default: `ENFORCE_CREDENTIALS=true` makes `required` credentials fail closed at accept (403 naming what is missing), because a licensed private hire operator and a lift-sharing co-op run the same code with genuinely different obligations. The schema rejects a credential carrying a `fareMultiplier` — a licence is not a service class.

**Third-party identity**: not collected. Legacy `passenger` fields are ignored. Numeric stop/seat counts are sufficient for generic multi-stop/no-money coordination.

**Waiting time (Mode A)**: after `arrive`, `start` adds `max(0, waited - FREE_WAITING_MINUTES)` at the rate card's own per-minute rate to `ride.fare` and records `ride.waiting`. The operator holds no money, so this is not a charge it levies — it recalculates the number both parties settle peer-to-peer, with the timer visible to both before it costs anything. Priced only AFTER `startTrip()` validates the transition (a second `/start` must never stack a second charge) and only once (`!ride.waiting`).

**Pickup notes**: `pickup_note` on request, or `note` on `POST /api/rides/:id/pickup` (a note-only edit needs no coordinates and touches neither route nor price). Participant-gated free text capped at 140 chars: in memory, never in a pre-accept payload, never in the kind 30078 snapshot.

**Participant alerts**: `pushToParticipant` reaches whichever party is NOT currently watching the ride socket (`participantSocketOpen` via the WS-authenticated pubkey) — matched (with vehicle + ETA), arrived, cancelled-by-the-other-party, pickup moved/note added. Push subscriptions carry `role`, so a rider device is never swept into job dispatch.

**Multi-stop trips**: a request may carry up to three ordered stops. A real road route covers every leg. Blind mode sends the coordinator only `stopCount` and route totals; exact stops live in the participant-encrypted itinerary and are absent from snapshots.

### Payment Providers (Factory Pattern)

`payment-providers/factory.js` — Factory + fallback chain via `ResilientStakeManager`. All providers extend `payment-providers/base.js` with the interface: `lockStake()`, `releaseStake()`, `forfeitStake()`, `healthCheck()`, `getCapabilities()`.

Providers: `cash` (record-only, no custody — fare settles face-to-face, inDrive model), `lnd` (hodl invoices, regtest-proven semantics: release = cancel/refund, forfeit = settle/claim penalty; `confirmStakePaid()` gates enforcement on the payment actually being held), `demo` (mock for testing). Experimental (never verified against their real APIs, legacy both-stakes key convention): `btcpay`, `alby`, `cln`. Planned, not yet implemented: `nwc` (NIP-47 hold invoices), `stripe` (pure fiat), Cashu, M-Pesa — the factory throws a clear error if these are selected.

Stake interface is **per-stake**: `releaseStake`/`forfeitStake`/`getStakeStatus` take a stakeId of `${rideId}_${role}`. Non-instant rails (`instantLock: false`) return `awaiting_payment` from the stake endpoints and require a confirm call (`/rides/:id/{rider,driver}-stake/confirm` on the legacy flow, `/api/tasks/:id/{requester,provider}-stake/confirm` on the task flow), which calls the provider's `confirmStakePaid()`.

**Stake persistence**: LND stake state (including hodl preimages) is persisted to the `stakes` table and restored via `setStakeStore()` on boot — a restart must never strand held HTLCs. **Provider unification**: `paymentProvider` IS the stake manager's primary provider (one instance, one state). Fallback providers must share the primary's trust model; per-stake operations route to the provider that created the stake.

Every payment event includes explicit `amount`, `currency`, and `trust_model` tags. Amounts are in the smallest unit of the specified currency (pence for GBP, cents for USD, satoshis for SAT).

Selected via `PAYMENT_PROVIDER` env var, with optional `PAYMENT_FALLBACKS` for resilience. The demo provider refuses to boot with `NODE_ENV=production` unless `ALLOW_DEMO_PAYMENTS=true`. **Domain-independent** — works identically across all use cases.

### Pricing

`src/pricing/fiat-conversion.js` — BTC/fiat price conversion. Exports `getBitcoinPrice()`, `estimateTripCost()`, `fetchBitcoinPrices()`. Used by `server.js` for fare estimates and dual-currency display. **Domain-independent.**

`src/osrm-routing.js` — Legacy routing helper (`getRoute()`), imported directly by `server.js`. Predates the `navigation/` factory; both are still used.

### Navigation Providers (Factory Pattern)

`navigation/factory.js` — Same factory pattern. All providers extend `navigation/base.js`. `navigation/service.js` provides the high-level routing API consumed by server code. Providers: `osrm` (self-hosted), `ors` (OpenRouteService API). Selected via `NAVIGATION_PROVIDER` env var. **Domain-independent.**

### Nostr Integration

- **`src/nostr/kinds.js`** — **Single source of truth for event kinds**, aligned with the TROTT spec v0.9 table. Never hardcode a kind number; import from here. Governance experiments (watchdog/slashing/suspension/appeals/votes) live in an explicit experimental block (39500+) so they can never collide with spec-assigned kinds.
- **`src/nostr/reputation.js`** — Reputation queries (TROTT-03, kind 30520 ratings; kind 30540 emergency signals) via `SimplePool`. 30-second cache. Aggregates verify signatures and dedupe one rating per (rater, task); `p` tags must be hex. Relay reads/writes carry a 5s timeout. **Domain-independent.**
- **`src/nostr/stake-events.js`** — Publishes TROTT-04 payment events: 30532 Escrow Lock, 30533 Settlement (`outcome`: released/forfeited/partial_forfeit), 30535 Payment Receipt. **Domain-independent.**
- **`src/nostr/operator-announce.js`** — Operator discoverability: kind 30511 service announcement at startup, kind 30554 heartbeat every 5 minutes. Advertises `PUBLIC_RELAY_URLS` and `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`.
- **Outbox**: operator-signed events that reach no relay are persisted (`nostr_outbox` table) and retried every 60s — never silently dropped.

### Middleware

- **`middleware/nip98-auth.js`** — NIP-98 HTTP auth. Validates signed `Authorization: Nostr <base64>` headers (kind 27235). Single-use auth events on mutating requests (replay rejected); optional `payload` tag is verified against the body hash. Toggle with `ENABLE_NIP98_AUTH`. **Domain-independent.**
- **`middleware/rate-limit.js`** — Rate limiting. When `ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING` is not `false`, all mutating `/api|/rides` routes share the authenticated limiter; hot read routes carry `publicRateLimiter`. `trust proxy` is set for correct per-IP buckets behind Caddy/nginx. **Domain-independent.**
- **WebSocket auth** — when `ENABLE_NIP98_AUTH=true`, sockets must send `{type:'auth', event:<kind 27235, method GET>}` first; `subscribe_ride` is participant-only; `register_driver`/`driver_location` use the verified pubkey (spoofing rejected).

### Frontend

Two frontends exist:

- **`public/`** — Legacy vanilla JS web apps (`rider-app.js`, `driver-app.js`, `demo.html`). No build step — served as static files by Express.
- **`web/`** — React/TypeScript SPA (Vite + Tailwind CSS). Domain-agnostic — fetches profile from `/api/domains/current` and renders labels, features, and state machine from the active domain. Pages under `web/src/pages/requester/` and `web/src/pages/provider/` with shared components in `web/src/components/`. Routes use `/request/*` and `/provide/*` (with `/ride/*` and `/drive/*` as backward-compatible redirects). Uses direct `leaflet` integration for maps, `nostr-tools` v2 for Nostr integration, and `geohash-kit` for working-area polygon coverage. Built output goes to `web/dist/`.

  **Identity as people, not keys** (`web/src/services/profiles.ts`, `PersonCard`): names and avatars come from the counterparty's OWN kind 0 metadata, read from public relays and signature-verified in the client — the operator never asserts an identity, exactly as it never asserts a rating. A key with no metadata falls back to a short `npub1abc…wxyz` identifier. `NameEditor` on the profile page publishes your own kind 0 (preserving fields set in other Nostr clients). Every screen that used to print a truncated npub now shows a person.

  **Progressive disclosure on the active screens** (`web/src/components/layout/Sheet.tsx`): both active-task pages render a capped `Sheet` (status, the person, the current action, a running waiting meter) with everything else — meeting up, chat, safety, payment — behind `SheetSection` disclosures that remember their open state. They previously stacked up to thirteen always-open panels beneath a `flex-1` map, which on a phone left no map and pushed the primary action below the fold. `StatusBadge` renders a translated sentence keyed off the stable STATE KEY ("Kwame is on the way"), not the raw uppercased enum.

  **Driver dispatch UX**: the incoming-job card leads with fare, **distance/ETA to the pickup** (`web/src/utils/pickup-distance.ts` — the number a driver actually decides on) and an `AcceptCountdown` ring that releases the offer rather than holding it silently. Declining is remembered for the session (`dispatchService.declineAvailable`), so the 30 s open-list reconcile no longer re-offers a job the driver just turned down; `clearDeclined()` brings them back. The dashboard headlines the driver's OWN day — today's earnings, trips, hours online (`web/src/utils/shift.ts`) and a £/hour figure withheld until a meaningful stretch has run — instead of platform-wide ride counts. Jobs are ranked nearest-first with fare breaking ties.

  **Receipts and rebook** (`Receipt`, `HistoryPage`): a past trip opens a real receipt — base/distance/time rows, waiting time, tip, any demand multiplier, who drove, which rail — and offers the same journey again in one tap. Device-local like the rest; the operator holds no copy.

  The provider app's dispatch singleton (`web/src/services/dispatch.ts`) keeps an **available-jobs list**: every broadcast lands in it (nothing dropped while another job is on screen) and it reconciles against `GET /api/tasks/open` every 30 s, rendered on the dashboard. `/provide/areas` (`WorkingAreasPage`) lets the driver draw polygon working areas on the map; `geohash-kit`'s `polygonToGeohashes` covers each polygon with ≤64 multi-precision cells (`web/src/utils/working-areas.ts`, persisted in localStorage) which register with the dispatcher and filter both broadcasts and the open-jobs list. **Destination mode** (`web/src/utils/destination-mode.ts`, dashboard control) is a purely client-side corridor filter: only jobs whose approximate dropoff makes ≥1 km progress toward (or ends within 2 km of) the driver's chosen destination are shown — the destination never leaves the device; jobs are stored unfiltered so clearing the mode instantly restores them.

  Prices render **fiat-first** (`DualPrice`: the local currency leads, sats secondary) and the account page speaks plain English ("Account ID", "recovery key") with npub/nsec visible but secondary — normie adoption is the goal. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs backend tests on Node 20 and 22 (matching the Dockerfile; Node 18 is EOL) plus web typecheck/tests/build on every push and PR.

  **i18n** (`web/src/i18n/`): a framework-free `t()`/`td()` runtime — flat en/sw dictionaries, `{param}` interpolation, per-key English fallback, `useT()` re-renders on switch. Locale auto-detects Swahili from the browser (KES market) with a manual toggle on the profile page (`donkeyride.locale`). `td()` translates server-sent domain labels (`dyn.*` keys — driver→dereva, ride→safari) and passes unknown domains through. First-pass Kiswahili needs native review before a Kenyan pilot. The i18n test suite enforces placeholder parity and no orphan sw keys. **Saved places** (`web/src/utils/places.ts`): pinned Home/Work plus recents in `AddressSearch`, device-local like everything else.

  **Rider parity features**: a **service-class picker** on the request screen (real per-class prices from the estimate, not a guessed multiplier), a **meeting note** field ("black gate, side entrance") editable again from the active page, **favourite providers** (`web/src/utils/favourites.ts`, starred on the completion page, sent as `preferred_providers` so they get first refusal), **rider Web Push** (`enableTaskPush`, permission asked on the request tap; `sw.js` routes by payload `url`), and a **waiting timer** (`WaitingTimer`) shown to both sides from arrival. Driver side: **trip sharing is no longer rider-only** — `TripSharePanel role="provider"` names the passenger instead of the car, completion sends the all-clear and panic forwards to the driver's own guardians; the **profile page shows your own standing** (client-verified, exactly as a stranger sees it); and the driver declares which **vehicle classes** they can take in `VehicleEditor`, plus sees the rider's note and pickup address on the active job.

  **Progressive disclosure on the CONFIRM and DASHBOARD screens too** (`Sheet`): the request screen used to stack eight always-open blocks under a `flex-1` map — price, breakdown, class picker, stops, note, access needs, timing, women-only — with the primary button below the fold and **the class picker underneath the breakdown it determines**. It is now a capped `Sheet` (price, surge notice, class picker) with stops/note/passenger/access/timing behind `SheetSection` disclosures that badge what is set, plus a pinned action bar whose button carries the price being agreed to. The driver dashboard had the same disease with GO ONLINE fifth down; the shift control is now pinned and everything else is in the sheet.

  **Bottom navigation** (`web/src/components/layout/BottomNav.tsx`): rider (ride/trips/help/account) and driver (shift/earnings/areas/account), 56 px targets, hidden on the immersive task screens where the next action is the only thing that matters.

  **Changing the destination** (`DestinationChanger` on the rider's active page): search a new destination, see the re-priced fare and the difference against the old one, then confirm. Two taps, never a silent reprice. Uses the `preview` half of the dropoff endpoint.

  **Live ETA** (`web/src/utils/eta.ts`): while the car approaches, minutes plus a clock time ("about 14:32"). Once moving, the headline becomes time to the DESTINATION — a live `eta_seconds` when the provider's app sends one, otherwise the booking estimate less elapsed time, floored at a minute so an overrunning trip never counts backwards.

  **Cancellation reasons and rating tags**: `CancelReasonPicker` on both cancel confirmations (one tap, optional) and `FeedbackTags` on both completion screens — praise codes above 4 stars, problem codes at or below, published as `feedback` tags inside the signed kind 30520 event where any aggregator can count them.

  **Disputes and help** (`DisputePanel`, `pages/shared/HelpPage.tsx`, `/request/help` and `/provide/help`): the operator's dispute subsystem (claims, evidence, arbiter assignment, resolution, appeals) existed server-side with no door. A participant now signs a kind 7543 claim from the completion screen, the no-show screen or the help page. Help also reaches the person who was actually there: a completed trip keeps `providerPubkey` in device-local history, so **"left something in the car" opens the same NIP-17 chat rail** with the driver after the job is over.

  **Chat quick replies**: four role-aware canned messages ("I'm outside", "Two minutes away", "I can't stop here"), because the other party is either driving or standing in the rain.

  **Driver: credentials, demand, and the destination in words** — `CredentialsEditor` on the profile page (with expiry and a renewal warning) and a dashboard notice when required paperwork is undeclared; `DemandPanel` showing the busiest cells nearest first; the drop-off address rendered as text on the active job (`dropoffAddress` was never even normalised, so the only way to know where you were going was to accept the nav hand-off); action-button labels from translation and the domain profile instead of a hardcoded English map; "finish for the day after this job"; and an earnings CSV export, because self-employed drivers file their own returns and this operator keeps no durable record to produce a statement from later.

  **Offline and reduced motion**: `useOnline`/`OfflineBanner` say it once at the top instead of every screen failing in its own dialect (nothing is disabled — a live job keeps running), the domain-load failure screen says "you are offline" when that is what happened, indefinite animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`, and status changes are `aria-live` regions for anyone who cannot glance at the map.

  **Pickup that behaves like Uber/Bolt**: the rider never searches for the spot they are standing on. `HomePage` takes the GPS fix as the pickup the moment it lands (never the London fallback — a denied/pending fix leaves it unset), names it with `web/src/utils/reverse-geocode.ts` (Photon reverse, same key-less backend as the address search, ~11 m cache), and makes **"Where to?"** the only field. The pickup row shows `Current location · <street>` with a Change control (search, tap the map, drag the pin, or "use my current location"); picking a destination without a fix asks for the pickup instead of bouncing back. After requesting, `PickupAdjuster` on the rider's active page plus a draggable pickup pin move the meeting point until arrival (see "Moving the pickup"); the driver's active page toasts the change loudly and refetches. The rider's headline number while the car approaches is now **arrival ETA** (`eta_seconds` on the provider's `location_update`, previously dropped in normalisation), not the trip length.

  **Women-only matching** (self-declared, Bolt W4W-style, both directions): a declared-woman rider can flag a request `women_only`; a declared-woman driver can opt to receive only such requests. Pairing is enforced across live broadcast, registration replay, web push and the open list (`?gender=woman`), and accept returns 403 without the declaration (`sanitiseGender`/`genderEligible` in `server.js`). Fail closed for the request side; ordinary requests carry no gender data; the flag is deliberately **excluded from the Nostr snapshot** (special-category data never reaches relays — the constraint is lost on operator restart by design). Client: `web/src/utils/gender.ts` (device-local), `WomenSafetyCard` on the profile page, honest self-attestation copy everywhere.

  **No-show accountability** (Mode-A native — reputational, not financial): the wronged party ticks "didn't show up" while cancelling; the client signs a kind 30520 event flagged `no_show` (carrying rating 1 so every aggregator prices it in), publishes it to public relays and best-effort mirrors it to `POST /rate` — which accepts exactly this event class on a cancelled ride. Both aggregators surface `noShowCount`; `ReputationBadge` shows it pre-accept. Never operator-asserted.

  **Trip audio recording** (`web/src/services/trip-audio.ts`, `TripAudioRecorder` on both active pages): opt-in mic recording that never leaves the phone — AES-GCM encrypted with a key derived from the user's own key + task id, stored in IndexedDB (in-memory fallback), auto-deleted after 72 h unless exported. Consent-forward: jurisdiction-honest notice before starting, and the counterparty is automatically notified over the E2E chat, so every recording is all-party-informed. Operator-blind.

  **Web Push job alerts** (VAPID, no Firebase): a backgrounded driver app gets a push instead of the WS frame. Operator side: `src/push.js` (in-memory subscriptions — endpoint URLs are device PII, never persisted), `GET /api/push/vapid-key`, `POST|DELETE /api/push/subscribe`, and `pushRideRequestToOfflineDrivers` in `server.js` (same area/radius semantics as WS dispatch; skips drivers with an open socket; payload is E2E encrypted per RFC 8291 and carries no rider identity or exact coordinates). Client side: `web/src/services/push.ts` subscribes on Go online (the permission prompt rides that tap), re-subscribes on area changes, unsubscribes on Go offline; `sw.js` shows the notification and focuses `/provide` on tap. Keys: `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`/`VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`/`VAPID_SUBJECT` (ephemeral dev keys generated at boot when unset).

  **Native driver wraps** (`docs/NATIVE-APPS.md`): the rider app stays PWA-first; the driver app is wrapped by Capacitor for Android AND iOS (`web/android`, `web/ios`, appId `app.donkeyride.driver`). The platforms are NOT equal and the docs say so: Android runs a foreground-service location watcher (which also keeps the WebView and dispatch socket alive) plus UnifiedPush for off-shift alerts; iOS runs `ShiftLocationPlugin.swift` (the app's own CLLocationManager plugin — the community plugin is excluded there via `ios.includePlugins: []` because it does not compile against Capacitor 8) and has NO off-shift alert rail at all. Toolchain floor: Capacitor 8 hides `CAPPluginCall.reject` behind a Swift 6.1 flag, so on Xcode 16.2 the iOS plugin reports failures as a resolved `{error}` payload and `native-location.ts` reads both shapes. Builds clean for the simulator; unverified on hardware.

  **UnifiedPush in the Android wrap** (`docs/ANDROID-PUSH.md`): the Push API does not exist in an Android WebView, so the wrapped driver app takes a second transport — the driver's own distributor (ntfy or any other), no Firebase. It yields an ordinary Web Push subscription, so **the operator is unchanged**: same `/api/push/subscribe` payload, same RFC 8291 encryption, same VAPID keys. `web/src/services/unified-push.ts` bridges to `UnifiedPushPlugin.java`/`DonkeyPushService.java`; `push.ts` picks the transport and `dispatch.ts` never learns which one. Fails loudly by design — no distributor installed means a dashboard notice, never a silent fallback to Google's transport, and a message that will not decrypt is dropped rather than shown as "something happened". `getPushState()`/`onPushStateChange()` drive that notice. NOT yet verified on real hardware.

  **Federated job discovery**: rider task announcements (kind 37500) carry `operator` + `api` tags, and while online the driver app also subscribes to them on the public relays (`web/src/services/federation.ts`) — jobs coordinated by OTHER operators land in the same available-jobs list badged "via Nostr · host". Relevance mirrors dispatch (working areas win, else radius against the decoded geohash centre); own-operator jobs are excluded; the `api` tag is untrusted (https-only origins, localhost dev exempt) and job details are fetched from that operator's public open endpoint, never taken from the relay event. **Phase 2 (in-place cross-operator lifecycle) is shipped**: a federated job is accepted and run from this app, because the driver's key means the same thing at every operator. `Task.operatorBase` carries the coordinating operator; `request()` takes an optional base and `stampOrigin()` re-attaches it to every response, so a single refresh cannot silently redirect the next call to an operator that has never heard of the job. The task socket follows the job too (`wsUrlForOrigin`), and the origin is persisted per role so a restart mid-job rehydrates against the right operator (`getActiveParticipantTask` only ever knows OUR jobs, so a null answer with a stored foreign origin is not "no job"). The origin is re-validated with `safeOperatorOrigin` on the way out of storage, not just on the way in. Foreign job details are now fetched through the SIGNED api path — a bare fetch got 401 from every NIP-98-enabled operator, which silently emptied discovery against exactly the operators worth federating with. Ratings publish to relays as always and mirror to the coordinating operator. **First-run onboarding** (`web/src/components/onboarding/Onboarding.tsx`): a role-aware 3-slide intro shown once per device, covering the no-account pitch, direct payment, and — for drivers — notifications plus the iOS add-to-home-screen step push requires.

  **Pickup verification code** (`web/src/services/pickup-code.ts`, `PickupCode` on both active pages, match → trip start): both phones derive the same 4-digit PIN + word from the pair's NIP-44 ECDH conversation key + ride id — requires one of the two private keys, so the operator cannot derive it and an impostor car cannot show it. No server state, nothing published.

  **Trip sharing** (`web/src/services/trip-share.ts`, `TripSharePanel` on the rider's active page): flock's share → all-clear → alert pattern over the same NIP-17 gift-wrap rail as chat. The rider saves trusted-contact npubs (device-local) and sends them an E2E encrypted trip note (driver npub, approximate route) as a plain kind 14 DM — readable in ANY NIP-17 DM client, no DonkeyRide account needed. Completion auto-sends an all-clear to everyone the trip was shared with; a panic also fires them an alert with last known location. Contacts flagged **"Every trip"** are auto-shared the moment a driver is matched (`autoShareTrip`, once per task). Operator-blind throughout. Deliberately message-based, not live tracking; full flock-circle integration (group envelope keys) stays in the Flock app.

  **Ride check** (`web/src/utils/ride-check.ts`, `RideCheckPrompt` on the rider's active page): the rider's own phone watches the in-progress trip against `routeGeometry` — a sustained (2 min) deviation >500 m or a >5 min stop raises "Everything OK?"; if the trip was shared and the rider doesn't respond within 60 s, guardians are alerted automatically (`sendRideCheckAlert`). Pure anchor-based detection (slow creep never fires; a single wild GPS fix never fires; the `useLocation` London fallback is never ingested). Nothing leaves the device unless escalation fires. Panic surfaces a locale-mapped emergency number as a `tel:` link (`web/src/utils/emergency.ts`).

  **In-app chat** (`web/src/services/chat.ts`, `ChatPanel` on both active-task pages) is end-to-end encrypted NIP-17 gift-wrapped DMs exchanged directly between the participants over public relays — the operator never carries or sees a message. The unwrap is verified (seal signature + seal/rumor pubkey match — checks `nostr-tools`' own `unwrapEvent` skips); the ride id threads via the rumor's `subject` tag inside the encryption, and a self-addressed wrap makes history replay after refresh. **Reputation is never self-reported and never operator-trusted**: accept ignores any `driver_rating`, `TaskManager` stores no default rating, `/api/drivers/available` reports `rating: null` for anonymised live drivers, and `ReputationBadge` renders a **client-verified** aggregate — `web/src/services/reputation.ts` reads kind 30520/30540 events from public relays directly, verifies every signature in the client, and dedupes one rating per (rater, task); `GET /api/reputation/:npub` is only the fallback when relays are unreachable. Rider sees the driver at match; driver sees the requester on the incoming-job screen, including any emergency signals.

**Frontend data flow** centres on three React contexts (`web/src/context/`):
  - `DomainContext` — active domain profile (labels, features, state machine)
  - `IdentityContext` — Nostr keypair and identity management
  - `TaskContext` — current task state and lifecycle

**PII module** (`web/src/modules/pii/`) — isolated components for sensitive data: `LiveTracker`, `MapSection`, `LocationProvider`, `RetentionNotice`. Keeps PII-handling code separate from general UI for GDPR compliance.

### Three-Layer Architecture

```
NOSTR (public, permanent)     →  Discovery + Reputation + Operator Bonds + State snapshots (durability)
OPERATOR (thin, non-custodial)→  Coordination only (in-memory, ephemeral). NEVER touches funds.
WEBSOCKET (ephemeral)         →  Real-time tracking + Live updates
```

### Non-custodial + database-free (production default)

The default production operator runs with **no database and no Redis** and is
**non-custodial** — it is a coordination service, not a payment institution:

- **No money.** Every provider declares `getCustodyModel()`; the boot gate
  (`adoptPaymentProvider`) refuses any `custodial` rail unless
  `OPERATOR_LICENSED_CUSTODIAN=true`. Default rail is `cash` (record-only,
  custody `none`): fares settle peer-to-peer, the operator moves £0
  (`operator_transmitted: 0` on every settlement). `/info.regulatory` states
  the posture (`money_transmitter: false`, `settlement: peer-to-peer`).
  `OPERATOR_FEE_PERCENT` defaults to 0 — the operator takes no cut of a fare it
  never holds. Custodial Lightning rails (lnd/btcpay/alby/cln) exist for
  licensed Mode-B operators only.
- **No database.** `DATABASE_URL` is optional. Durability comes from Nostr: the
  operator publishes a kind 30078 state snapshot on every task mutation via
  `setSnapshotPublisher`, and rehydrates non-terminal tasks from its own
  snapshots on boot (`rehydrateFromNostr`). Exact PII is in-memory and
  ephemeral — lost on restart by design (a GDPR feature, not a bug). The
  Nostr outbox falls back to an in-memory buffer when there is no DB.
  **The snapshot is SEALED** (NIP-44, to the operator's own key) and its tags
  reduced to `d` + `expiration`. Reducing location to a geohash was not
  enough on its own: a pubkey plus a ~1 km cell plus a timestamp, `p`-tagged
  and repeated across a person's journeys, is a public travel history and
  somebody's home address — coarse location is not anonymous location. The
  snapshot has exactly one legitimate reader (this operator, at boot), so it
  is written for that reader alone; a relay stores it without being able to
  read it. Never degrade to plaintext: with no key, `publishTaskSnapshot`
  publishes nothing. `NOSTR_SNAPSHOTS=false` switches them off entirely for
  an operator that has a database. Pinned by
  `tests/integration/snapshot-privacy.test.js`.
- **No Redis.** Driver presence is in-memory and ephemeral. Redis only ever fed
  demo bot fleets and is off by default (`DISABLE_REDIS=true`).
- Operators who legitimately need durable PII (a licensed Mode-B firm under
  GDPR controller obligations) opt in by setting `DATABASE_URL`; the store is
  then used automatically. It is never in OUR loop.

### What may be left on a public relay

A relay is append-only infrastructure nobody controls: there is no delete, no
retention policy and no access log. So the test for anything published is not
"does this look identifying" but **"who reads this, and what can be joined to
it?"** Three rules follow, and all three have been broken here before:

1. **Only DISCOVERY is public.** Discovery has to reach strangers, so it is
   coarse and disposable: the availability beacon (20500, geohash-5, ephemeral
   kind so relays do not store it) and the task announcement (37500,
   geohash-5, NIP-40 expiry). Everything else on a relay is either DURABILITY
   (write for yourself → seal it: the 30078 snapshot) or ACCOUNTABILITY (must
   be publicly attributable → ratings 30520, panic 30540). Nothing else earns
   a place.
2. **Watch the join key, not just the fields.** Every task event shares the
   task id in its `d` tag, so any two of them compose. This is how the 30078
   snapshot became a public travel history: the requester was not even
   `p`-tagged, but they signed their own 37500 announcement under the same
   task id with their identity key, and one relay query for
   `authors:[them]` linked a person to every pickup cell, dropoff cell, fare
   and driver they had ever had. **Task announcements are therefore signed by
   a throwaway key** (`publishTaskAnnouncement` generates one per
   announcement; `parseTaskAnnouncement` never reads the author, and drivers
   resolve jobs against the operator's authenticated API). Pinned by
   `web/src/services/events.test.ts`.
3. **A publish needs a reader and a disposable join key where possible.**
   Direct-mode riders subscribe to kind 20500 to count coarse nearby supply;
   task acceptance uses the separate per-journey rendezvous path, so the
   beacon author does not need to be the account or reputation anchor. The
   provider therefore signs availability with a random memory-only key reused
   for one online shift and discarded by Go Offline. This prevents a
   cryptographic join to the account and other shifts, but does not stop a
   subscriber correlating cells within that shift or using IP/timing across
   shifts. Managed coordination has its authenticated presence socket and
   keeps public beacons off unless explicitly opted in. Pinned by the direct
   Playwright journey and `web/src/services/shift-identity.test.ts`.

Applications of the same reasoning:

- **`p` tags are a per-person index.** A tag makes an event queryable by
  subject for ever. Ratings need that (reputation is the point). A payment
  receipt does not: kind 30535 is **off by default**
  (`PUBLISH_PAYMENT_RECEIPTS`) and carries no `p` tags when enabled, so it
  stays verifiable to whoever holds the task id without becoming a public
  bank statement. Nothing in this repo reads it back — both parties keep
  device-local history.
- **A panic is a flag, not a fix.** Kind 30540 must stay public and attached
  to the pubkey so aggregators price it in, so it carries geohash-5 and
  **never exact coordinates** — a permanent public record of precisely where
  a frightened person stood helps whoever they are frightened of. Exact
  position goes where it acts: NIP-17 to the rider's guardians, and the
  participant-gated task socket for the counterparty (out-of-band on the
  `/panic` body, never inside the signed event). The operator refuses to
  relay an event carrying a `location` tag but still processes the alert —
  a privacy rule must never break the safety path. 30540 is ADDRESSABLE, so
  it needs a `d` tag of the task id: without one every alert a person raises
  shares `d=""` and each new one silently replaces the last. Pinned by
  `tests/integration/panic-privacy.test.js`.
- **Auth-off is an open deployment, not a weaker one.** `authoriseRideActor`
  and `subscribe_ride` can only check participation when there is a signature
  to check; without one they admit anyone holding a task id, and task ids are
  on public relays. The server therefore **refuses to boot** with
  `NODE_ENV=production` and `ENABLE_NIP98_AUTH` unset
  (`ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=true` for a throwaway demo), and the socket
  verifies participation whenever it has an identity, toggle or not.
- **The two relay lists are opposite calls, on purpose.** `NOSTR_RELAYS` (the
  OPERATOR's) defaults to **nowhere**: it publishes on behalf of other people,
  so a default pointing at a stranger's relay is how riders' journeys leaked
  (`tests/integration/relay-defaults.test.js`). `PUBLIC_RELAY_URLS` and
  `web/src/services/relays.ts`'s `FALLBACK_RELAYS` keep large third-party
  relays **deliberately**: they carry what a client publishes about ITSELF,
  and every kind on them is one whose value IS public readability — kind 0
  profiles, 30520 ratings, 30540 panic, NIP-17 wraps a counterparty reads in
  any DM client, throwaway-signed 37500 announcements. Narrowing them to one
  operator makes a driver's reputation invisible to anyone not already
  pointed at that operator, which is the lock-in the protocol exists to
  avoid. Do not "tidy" these into one list.

### Settlement rails (`settlement/`) — how riders actually pay

Distinct from `payment-providers/` (custodial escrow stakes, gated off by
default). Settlement rails are **non-custodial**: the rider pays the driver
DIRECTLY and the operator only advertises, resolves, and verifies. Every rail
reports `custody() === 'none'`.

- `settlement/lnaddress.js` — Lightning wallet-to-wallet via LNURL-pay
  (LUD-16/06/21). Resolves the driver's Lightning Address to a bolt11 invoice
  the rider pays from their own wallet; verifies by preimage
  (`SHA256(preimage)===payment_hash`, offline via `ln-service.parsePaymentRequest`)
  or LUD-21 verify URL. **Also carries Tando** (a `2547…@bitcoin.co.ke` address
  that settles to M-Pesa) — proven live against bitcoin.co.ke.
- `settlement/mpesa.js` — record-only direct Send Money (driver's number, rider
  enters the confirmation code). No paybill/STK/B2C (those are custodial).
- `settlement/cashu.js` — record-only ecash: the rider sends the Cashu token to
  the driver over the E2E chat (the token IS the money, so it must never pass
  through the operator — `verify` refuses a pasted token outright). Driver may
  advertise an optional NUT-18 payment request (`creq...`, public-safe).
- `settlement/cash.js`, `settlement/index.js` (registry: getRail/validateHandle/
  normaliseHandle/isPublicSafe/listRails). Tando normalises a bare Kenyan number
  to a bitcoin.co.ke Lightning Address.
- Endpoints: `GET /api/settlement/rails`, `POST /api/rides/:id/payment-methods`
  (driver), `GET /api/rides/:id/payment-options` (participant),
  `POST /api/rides/:id/pay-instruction` (rider), `POST /api/rides/:id/settle`
  (rider), `POST /api/rides/:id/confirm-received` (driver). M-Pesa number is
  per-ride PII (in-memory, never relayed); Lightning handles are public-safe.
- NWC (NIP-47) is a **frontend** capability (rider's own wallet pays the
  driver's invoice); the operator never holds the connection secret.
- **Amounts**: `pay-instruction` sends **sats** to Lightning rails (lnaddress/
  lightning/tando) and the **fiat** figure (derived on demand via `satsToFiat`,
  so it survives Nostr rehydration) to fiat rails (mpesa/cash). `ride.fare` is
  always sats; there is no stored `fareFiat`.
- **Currencies**: `USD|EUR|GBP|KES` (`DEFAULT_FIAT_CURRENCY`, default GBP). KES is
  first-class for M-Pesa/Tando — CoinGecko has no KES, so BTC/KES is derived as
  BTC/USD × USD/KES (open.er-api.com). The default fare rate card is USD-quoted and
  auto-converted to the ride currency; operators set `FARE_BASE`/`FARE_PER_KM`/
  `FARE_PER_MINUTE` + `FARE_CURRENCY` for a local market (used verbatim).

### TROTT Protocol Specifications

The protocol is defined by the TROTT specifications and domain profiles in the [trott repository](https://github.com/TheCryptoDonkey/trott). See the [QUICK-REFERENCE](https://github.com/TheCryptoDonkey/trott/blob/main/specs/QUICK-REFERENCE.md) for the complete event kind table; this implementation's kinds are pinned in `src/nostr/kinds.js` and must track that table.

The protocol supports both **P2P** (no operator) and **operator-coordinated** models. A minimal implementation needs only TROTT-01 + TROTT-02 (14 event kinds).

### GDPR Compliance

The three-layer architecture supports GDPR compliance: public Nostr events use only pseudonymous identifiers, encrypted events use NIP-17 gift wrap for PII (erasable via crypto-shredding), and the operator database follows standard controller obligations. See `docs/GDPR-COMPLIANCE.md` for the full compliance guide, `docs/DPIA.md` (Article 35) and `docs/ROPA.md` (Article 30) — both pre-filled for the reference implementation, with deployment-specific rows marked **OPERATOR**.

**This service processes Article 9 special-category data, and it does not look like it in the code — it looks like a dispatch filter.** `accessOptions` (wheelchair, step-free, assistance dog) are *data concerning health* under Article 4(15): ticking one discloses a disability. Article 9(1) prohibits processing them without an Article 9(2) condition, here **explicit consent** — so `AccessNeedsPicker` states, BEFORE the checkbox, what the data says, what it is for, that only the assigned provider sees it, that it is never published and that it is deleted when the job ends. Consent that arrives after the affirmative act is not consent. The engineering side was already right (excluded from the snapshot, absent from every pre-accept payload, fails closed, and the profile schema *rejects* an access option carrying a `fareMultiplier` — needing a ramp must never cost more); what was missing was the lawful basis and the notice. Pinned by `web/src/components/task/AccessNeedsPicker.test.tsx`. Self-declared gender is **not** Article 9 on the ordinary reading — do not claim otherwise — but is handled to the same standard.

**Logs are storage.** Anything printed to stdout is durable: Docker keeps it on disk across restarts, outside the erasure story and outside every `/api` control. Production logs were found holding an npub plus, from a routing ERROR path, exact pickup and dropoff coordinates under one ride id — the travel history the sealed snapshot exists to prevent, one layer down. Never log a raw error from an HTTP call (`error.message` carries the URL; the error *object* also carries `cause` and, on axios-shaped errors, request headers). Use `safeErrorMessage()` from `src/log-redact.js`, and never log an identity in the lifecycle. Pinned by `tests/integration/log-privacy.test.js`.

## Testing

**Backend:** Uses Node.js built-in `node:test` module with `node:assert/strict`. Tests are in `tests/integration/`. Tests construct signed Nostr events manually for NIP-98 auth validation.

**Relay isolation is mandatory.** Any test that boots the server must
`require('../helpers/isolate-relays')` BEFORE `require('../../server.js')`.
The operator rehydrates non-terminal tasks from its own kind 30078 snapshots
at boot, so a test that can reach a relay starts with whatever is on it
already loaded — a developer's live jobs, or the last run's residue. That is
not hypothetical: it turned a demand-cell assertion from 3 into 12. Clearing
`NOSTR_RELAY` alone is not enough; `server.js` also reads `NOSTR_RELAYS` and
`REPUTATION_RELAYS`, and dotenv has loaded the developer's `.env` by then.
The helper clears all of them.

**Live relay tests** (`tests/live/`, `npm run test:live`) run against a REAL
relay — `wss://relay.trotters.cc`, which we control. They cover what mocking
by absence cannot: that a relay accepts a sealed snapshot, hands it back
byte-intact, that the operator can still rehydrate from the round trip, and
that a relay holding the event learns nothing from it. Skipped unless
`LIVE_RELAY_URL` is set, so they stay inert in CI and in `npm test`. They
leave no residue — a throwaway operator key per run, a unique task id, a
120-second NIP-40 expiry and an explicit tombstone in `after`. Never point
them at a relay you do not control.

Key test files:
- `reputation-flow.test.js` — NIP-98 auth validation, rating event publishing, reputation caching
- `domain-profiles.test.js` — Schema validation, profile loading, TaskManager lifecycle across all domains, RideManager backward compatibility
- `spec-domains.test.js` — The six spec-derived domains: every built-in profile driven through a full lifecycle, engine state keys pinned, rating weights summing to 1.0, requirements never carrying a fare multiplier
- `http-api.test.js` — Full HTTP lifecycle (request→accept→arrive→start→complete→rate) with signed NIP-98 requests, role authorisation (403s), cancellation, driver presence/geo-dispatch, task-store rehydration
- `open-rides.test.js` — Open-request browsing (`/api/rides/open` filters, identity redaction) and working-area dispatch over a real WebSocket (areas override radius, replay on register, REST-declared areas)
- `multi-stop.test.js` — Multi-stop validation, detour-covering estimates, stop-count-only pre-accept payloads, participant-gated exact stops
- `rider-experience.test.js` — Rider push role separation and matched/arrived alerts, participant-gated pickup notes, service-class pricing + visibility + accept guard, favourite head start (hidden, unacceptable, then open), waiting time added once past the free period
- `dropoff-change.test.js` — Changing the destination: preview prices without applying, a committed job DOES re-price, stops can be added after the request, works mid-trip, waiting survives, requester-only, refused once finished
- `back-to-back.test.js` — A finishing provider is judged from their drop-off as well as their position; an idle or not-yet-started one is not
- `demand.test.js` — Cell aggregation, single-person cells suppressed, matched and pre-booked work excluded, no pickups or identities in the payload
- `credentials.test.js` — What a domain publishes, a declaration reaching the requester, expired and unknown claims dropped, accepting ungated by default
- `pickup-change.test.js` — Moving the pickup: re-priced pre-commitment, fare-preserving and provider-notified post-commitment, distance cap, requester-only, frozen after arrival
- `women-only.test.js` — Women-only pairing over broadcast/replay/open list, fail-closed for undeclared drivers, accept 403 without the declaration
- `quote-integrity.test.js` — The upfront-price guarantee: quote fare == recorded fare (plain, multi-stop and per-class), breakdown rows sum exactly and track the rate card rather than fixed percentages
- `snapshot-privacy.test.js` — What the operator leaves on a relay: the 30078 snapshot names nobody and locates nothing, the operator can read back what it sealed, nobody else can, legacy plaintext is skipped rather than trusted, and no key means no snapshot at all
- `panic-privacy.test.js` — A coarse panic reaches relays; one carrying exact coordinates is withheld from relays but STILL processed (a privacy rule must never break the safety path); anything unparseable fails closed
- `payment-receipt.test.js` — No kind 30535 receipt by default; when opted in it is spec-shaped and carries no `p` tags
- `relay-defaults.test.js` — An unset relay list means NOWHERE. Two hardcoded fallbacks to `wss://relay.damus.io` (one in `reputation.js`, one in the `config` object) meant `NOSTR_RELAY=''` published to a large public relay instead; this pins that no third-party host is ever reachable unless named
- `live/relay-live.test.js` — Opt-in, against a real relay. See "Live relay tests" above
- `request-expiry.test.js` — Widening retry, capped radius, honest `no_providers` close-out, pre-booked rides unaffected, matched rides no longer retried
- `cancellation.test.js` — Grace window, late-cancellation flagging, wronged-party `late_cancel` report accepted, ordinary ratings still refused on a cancelled ride
- `access-needs.test.js` — Access needs never change the fare, fail closed on list and accept, every need must be met, absent from the Nostr snapshot
- `surge.test.js` — Off by default, capped, zero supply never surges, and a quote can never reprice upward on tap

**Frontend:** Uses vitest with `@testing-library/react` and jsdom. Run with `npm run web:test`.

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` for configuration. Key variables:
- `DOMAIN` — Domain profile selection (ridesharing|locksmith|delivery|towing|emergency-trades|pet-services|security|cleaning|moving, default: ridesharing)
- `OPERATOR_PUBKEY` / `OPERATOR_PRIVKEY` — Operator Nostr identity
- `PAYMENT_PROVIDER` — Payment backend (cash|lnd|btcpay|alby|cln|demo)
- `DEFAULT_FIAT_CURRENCY` — Ride pricing currency (USD|EUR|GBP|KES, default GBP; set KES for M-Pesa/Tando markets)
- `FARE_BASE` / `FARE_PER_KM` / `FARE_PER_MINUTE` / `FARE_CURRENCY` — Rate card (USD-quoted default, auto-converted; set FARE_CURRENCY to price verbatim in a local currency)
- `NAVIGATION_PROVIDER` — Routing backend (osrm|ors)
- `DATABASE_URL` — PostgreSQL connection (OPTIONAL; omit for the default non-custodial, DB-free operator)
- `REDIS_URL` — Redis connection (OPTIONAL; presence is in-memory. `DISABLE_REDIS=true` to skip)
- `OPERATOR_LICENSED_CUSTODIAN` — set true ONLY if you are a licensed payment institution running a custodial rail
- `PUBLIC_RELAY_URLS` / `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` — advertised to clients for Nostr discovery
- `NOSTR_RELAY` — Relay URL for event publishing
- `ENABLE_NIP98_AUTH` / `ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING` — Security toggles
- `REQUEST_RETRY_MS` / `REQUEST_EXPIRE_MS` / `DISPATCH_RADIUS_MAX_KM` — unmatched-request retry, expiry and the widening-search ceiling
- `SURGE_ENABLED` / `SURGE_MAX` / `SURGE_RADIUS_KM` / `SURGE_MIN_DEMAND` — demand pricing (OFF by default)
- `BACK_TO_BACK_LEAD_KM` — how close to their drop-off a provider must be before the next job is offered against where they are about to be (default 3)
- `DEMAND_MIN_WAITING` — below this, a demand cell is suppressed (default 2)
- `ENFORCE_CREDENTIALS` — set true to refuse accepts without the domain's required credentials (default false; declaration and display are always on)
- `CANCEL_GRACE_MS` — how long after matching a party may cancel with nothing recorded against them
- `OPERATOR_DATA_MODE` / `PUBLIC_ROUTING_URL` — blind participant routing versus managed operator routing

## Language & Style

All code, comments, documentation, commit messages, and user-facing strings must use **British English** spelling (e.g. colour, initialise, behaviour, licence, organise, authorisation, centre, metre, catalogue, serialise, favour, honour, recognise, customise).

## Key Design Constraints

- **Backward compatibility:** All changes to `TaskManager` must preserve the `RideManager` interface — existing code importing from `ride-manager.js` must continue to work unchanged.
- **Domain-agnosticism:** Core code (payment providers, navigation, middleware, Nostr integration) must work identically across all domain profiles. Domain-specific logic belongs in the profile, not in shared code.
- **Payment agnosticism:** All monetary amounts are currency-neutral (smallest unit of specified currency). Every payment event includes `amount`, `currency`, and `trust_model` tags. Never assume sats or any specific currency.
- **NIP-40 expiration:** Use `expiration` tag (not `expiry`) for all time-limited events, per NIP-40 specification.
- **NIP-44 encryption:** Use NIP-44 for encrypted payloads and NIP-17 (gift wrap) for private PII exchange. NIP-04 is deprecated — do not use it.
- **Social graph integration:** The protocol references NIP-02 (contact lists for trust weighting), NIP-32 (labelling for domain/trade categorisation), and NIP-56 (reporting for abuse flagging). These are optional but recommended for enhanced trust signals.
- **Generic location tags:** Domain profiles use `location_lat`/`location_lon` tags (not geohash-only) for location data. Geohash discovery (TROTT-02) remains the primary public discovery mechanism.
- **No linter configured:** There is no ESLint or Prettier setup. Follow existing code style.
- **Two Nostr library versions:** Backend uses `nostr-tools` v1 (`^1.17.0`); the React frontend uses `nostr-tools` v2 (`^2.10.4`). APIs differ between versions — check which context you're in.
- **Dual API paths:** `/api/tasks/*` and `/api/rides/*` are interchangeable (server rewrites tasks→rides). Frontend uses `/api/tasks/`; backend handlers use `/api/rides/`. Similarly `/api/providers/*` aliases `/api/drivers/*`.
